        <h3>The Goal</h3>        
        <p>A great way to learn about computer security is to put on a white hat and learn what it takes to exploit a computer system.  But, application owners usually frown upon people trying to break into their systems.  As an aternative to breaking the law, this simple game provides a safe place for users to learn how to exploit a web based API and learn about the types of threats for which an unprotected API is vulnerable.</p>
        <h3>What You'll Need</h3>
        <p>All you need to play is an HTTP client that can support GET, PUT, POST and DELETE.  For example, cURL, Postman, SOAP UI and RESTClient can all be used.</p>
        
        <h3>How to Play</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Start at level 0 and exploit an API to get the location of the next level's API.  Repeat until you reach the end of the game.</li>
            <li>Each level presents a unique challenge and the exploits get more difficult as you progress.</li>
            <li>Send an HTTP GET to <a href="/starthere">/starthere</a> and get started.</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <h3>The Rules</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Only HTTP requests are allowed</li>
            <li>No shell, malware or man in the middle attacks are allowed</li>
            <li>No denial of service attackas are allowed</li>
            <li>Don't break the server just because you can - please play nice.</li>
            <li>Try your best to use hints sparingly.</li>
        </ul>
